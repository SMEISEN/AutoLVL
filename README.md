<!----_Automation level taxonomy for time series forecasting services_---->

# Why should you consider automation for time series forecasting? ü§î
Automating the design and operation of forecasting models is essential to meet the growing demand for localized forecasts.
Although many automation methods exist, a clear guideline for creating new forecasting services is lacking.
AutoLVL fills this gap by offering a simple taxonomy for defining requirements, choosing methods, and clarifying the extent of automation achieved.
In particular, AutoLVL defines six automation levels, inspired by the SAE standard for autonomous driving.

# How is AutoLVL supporting architecture design of forecasting services? üôå
First, it's crucial to identify the requirements for the forecast's application.
For example, the forecast might need to handle missing or limited training data (cold-start problem) and automatically adapt to changes during operation.
Once the requirements are identified, the forecasting model can be selected, and the architecture of the forecasting service can be designed.
Since the taxonomy applies to all time series forecasting tasks, a generic service architecture can be created to handle different forecasting models.
